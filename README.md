What Are You Searching For?

If we are like a frog, we are always ourselves. But even a frog sometimes loses himself, and he makes a sour face. And if something comes along, he will snap at it and eat it. So I think a frog is addressing himself. I think you should do that also.

Because you lose yourself, your problem will be a problem for you.
If you do not lose yourself, then even though you have difficulty, there is actually no problem whatsoever. You just sit in the midst of the problem; when you are a part of the problem, or when the problem is a part of you, there is not problem, because you are the problem itself. The problem is you yourself. If this is so, there is no problem.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration
When your life is always a part of your surroundings - in other words, when you are called back to yourself, in the present moment - then there is no problem.

* Database creation

When you start to wonder about in some delusion which is something apart from you yourself, then your surroundings are also a misty, foggy delusion. Once you are in the midst of delusion, there is no end to delusion. You will be involved in deluded ideas one after another. Most of people live in delusion, involved in their problem, trying to solve their problem. But just to live is actually to live in problems. And to solve the problem is to be a part of it, to be be one with it.
