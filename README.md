What Are You Searching For?

If we are like a frog, we are always ourselves. But even a frog sometimes loses himself, and he makes a sour face. And if something comes along, he will snap at it and eat it. So I think a frog is addressing himself. I think you should do that also.

Because you lose yourself, your problem will be a problem for you.
If you do not lose yourself, then even though you have difficulty, there is actually no problem whatsoever. You just sit in the midst of the problem; when you are a part of the problem, or when the problem is a part of you, there is not problem, because you are the problem itself. The problem is you yourself. If this is so, there is no problem.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
